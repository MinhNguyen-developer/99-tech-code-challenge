# 99tech Code Challenge Repository

This repository contains a collection of coding challenges and projects demonstrating various programming concepts and implementations.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### üé® Fancy Form - Currency Swap Application
**Location**: `fancy-form/`

A modern, responsive currency swap interface built with React, TypeScript, and Ant Design. This application allows users to swap between different cryptocurrencies using real-time price data.

#### Features:
- **Token Icons**: Displays currency icons for better visual identification
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all form inputs
- **Auto-calculation**: Automatically calculates swap rates and output amounts
- **Currency Switching**: Easy switching between "from" and "to" currencies
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient background with glass-morphism effects

#### Technologies:
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Ant Design UI components
- Vite build tool

#### Getting Started:
```bash
cd fancy-form
npm install
npm run dev
```

### üî¢ Three Ways to Sum
**Location**: `three-ways-to-sum/`

A TypeScript project demonstrating three different approaches to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n.

#### Approaches:
1. **Mathematical Formula**: Using the arithmetic series formula `n(n+1)/2`
2. **Loop Method**: Traditional for-loop iteration
3. **Recursive Method**: Recursive function implementation

#### Technologies:
- TypeScript
- Node.js

#### Getting Started:
```bash
cd three-ways-to-sum
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

### üßπ Messy React Refactoring
**Location**: `messy-react/`

A demonstration of React code refactoring, showing the transformation from messy, unmaintainable code to clean, well-structured components.

#### Files:
- `Messy.tsx`: Original messy React component
- `Refactored.tsx`: Clean, refactored version

#### Purpose:
- Demonstrates best practices in React development
- Shows code organization and component structure
- Illustrates the importance of clean, maintainable code

## üöÄ Quick Start
